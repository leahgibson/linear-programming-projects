# Linear Programming Projects

As part of my class Math 510, Linear Programming, at Colorado State University, I need to complete two mini projects related to linear programming.

### Mini Project 1

I learned how to solve basic linear optimization problems using Python's SciPy package for the first mini project. My work for this project includes a short manual explainig how to set up and a linear optimization problem in Python and also introduces a made up problem as an example of application of linear programming. In addition to the manual, I've also included the two .py files of code I use to solve the problems discussed in the manual.
